      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup (310 ml) milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp melted butter</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until well combined.</li>
        <li>
          Gradually add the milk to the egg mixture, whisking continuously to incorporate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, whisking until a smooth batter forms.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the melted butter to complete the batter.</li>
        <li>
          Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour a small amount of batter into the skillet, tilting it to spread the batter evenly into a thin layer.
        </li>
        <li>Cook until the edges begin to lift and the bottom is lightly golden, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the crepe and cook for an additional 1 minute until fully set.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the cooked crepes on a plate.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
      </ol>
