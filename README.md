# Odin Recipes Project

## Project Description

The **Odin Recipes Project** is a simple recipe website developed as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It demonstrates the use of basic HTML and CSS to create a structured and visually appealing web application. Users can view a collection of recipes, each presented with a detailed description, list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions for preparation.

The current focus is on front-end implementation with static content for demonstration purposes.
